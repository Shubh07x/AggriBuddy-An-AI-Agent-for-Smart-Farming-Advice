# 🌾 AggriBuddy – Smart Farming AI Agent

An AI-powered farming assistant designed to empower small and marginal farmers with real-time, localized, and personalized agricultural advice. Built using IBM Watsonx and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this agent bridges the digital gap for farmers by offering support in regional languages for crop guidance, mandi prices, pest alerts, and more.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many small-scale farmers struggle due to the lack of timely, accessible, and localized agricultural information. Challenges like unpredictable weather, limited pest knowledge, and poor market access are common. Language and literacy barriers further prevent informed decisions.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

AggriBuddy is an AI agent trained using IBM Watsonx.ai that delivers real-time, grounded agricultural advice. It supports queries in local languages and uses trusted sources to provide region-specific responses on crops, weather, mandi rates, soil, and pest control.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Farmer asks a query (e.g., "Which crop is best in August in Kolhapur?")
2. IBM Granite model processes the query
3. Vector Index fetches grounded info from uploaded documents
4. Agent responds in simple language, optionally in local dialect
